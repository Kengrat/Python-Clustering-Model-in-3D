# Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm model in Python programming software that is used for statistical analysis
# which automatically groups the data points with similar characteristics and assigns them to clusters.
# The Country Data set contains ten variables and information about the country including child mortality, exports, imports, income, inflation, etc.
# The data sets were analyzed using a Clustering machine learning algorithm to investigate the country data set and generate visualizations that analyze the pattern of observed features
# K-Means Clustering package is deployed to analyze the export, import and income variable of the country data (2nd, 4th and 5th column).
# These variables are used to determine the economic strength of the countries. 
# Exports value are fitted into 0 to 200 on the x-axis using model.fit(X), imports values are fitted into y-axis of 0 to 175
# while the income value ranges between 0 to 130,000 on the z-axis of the 3D plot. Number of cluster point selected is three (3).
# The 3D plot categorizes the cluster points into three (0,1,2) centroids using the variables to depict that:
# Cluster 0 (Blue color) has very low to medium export values which depict countries with the weakest economic strength due to their lowest income and lowest export values.
# Cluster 1 (purple color) also has average to medium export values between 15 to 150 which are countries with average economic strengths due to medium income and medium export values.
# Cluster 2 (yellow color) has a medium to high export rate between 70 to 200 with very high-income values between 80,000 to 125,000,
# These are the strongest category of countries with very strong economic strengths, due to high income and high export values.
# Clustering model in Python has statistically analyse the countries in the dataset based on their economic strenght and this method can be applied to other dataset.
